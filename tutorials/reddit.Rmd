## What is Reddit?

Reddit may be unfamiliar to you as a social media website. The main home page of Reddit is an accumulate of the most liked and commented posts from a given time period.

Posts on Reddit are made to specific pages where users can posts about a dedicated topic. This pages are called subreddits. Subreddits exist for a wide range of different topics including [landscape photography](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/), [hiking](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/). These subreddits have different posting rules, for example some only allows image posts, while others only allow textual posts. Lets take a second to explore Reddit.

First, lets take a look at "r/EarthPorn". Now, don't be fooled by the name EarthPorn is not adult content but a collection of professional quality photographs of landscapes.There is also an armature level equivalent call "r/AmatureEarthPorn".

EarthPorn has strict criteria for what can be posted.

Other subreddits have more relaxed rules and allow posts of all kind, as long as they are on topic.

One aspect of Reddit that is advantageous over Flickr, is the discusive nature of comments. The posts can have 

Though data from Reddit has been used in a wide range of research disciplines such as political sciences, health sciences and technological development, it has not yet been widely explored for environmental sciences. We however believe that there is a great opportunity for a wide range of environmental applications as explored in [this paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/)

## Searching Reddit 

As with searching for Flickr photographs, the `photosearcher` package provides functionality to search Reddit for data. Please note that this function has just been developed for public use and has not been as robustly tested as the Flickr search, so if we get some unexpected errors please do not worry! We will also load some other packages that provide some nice functionality for accessing Reddit data.

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load_gh("ropensci/photosearcher")
p_load("dplyr")
```

Lets start by searching for posts associated with a specific term. For example, lets find all the posts associated with the word waterfall. The function is set up similar to the `photo_search()` function so we need to supply a start and end date. As Reddit has a massive database of posts lets quickly search for just one week. Reddit does allow for adult content, or not safe for work posts (NSFW), so to ensure these are removed we can select only posts that are not labeled as `over_18`.

```{r}
reddit_data <- reddit_search(search_term = "waterfall",
                             start_date = "2022-01-01",
                             end_date = "2022-01-08")

#remove over 18 content
reddit_data <- subset(reddit_data, "over_18" = FALSE)


#inspect data
head(reddit_data)[-1] #the -1 is to hide the authors names

#inspect the subreddits the data were posted too
reddit_data$subreddit

```

From inspecting the data we can see that quite a lot of these posts were not to subreddits relevant for landscape scale studies. Instead lets check out a specific subreddit of interest: "r/EarthPorn". Lets take a quick look at posts to EarthPorn, by returning all posts there for one day.

```{r}
reddit_data <- reddit_search(subreddit = "EarthPorn",
                             start_date = "2022-01-01",
                             end_date = "2022-01-02")


#inspect data
head(reddit_data)[-1] 

```

Now posts to this subreddit should all be photographs. One neat thing we can do with this is download the images for further inspection or analysis. In the next line of code everyone will download a random image from the returned data set to have a look at. First, everyone will generate a random number between 1 and the number of images returned. We will then use that number to downloaded the image in that row number.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#this code says, generate a random number, between 1, and the maximum number of rows in our data
number <- sample(1:nrow(reddit_data), 1)

#here we select the URL of the image that we want to download
file_url <- reddit_data$url[number]

#here we download the file and save it in the outputs folder with the name earthporn.jpg
download.file(file_url, './/outputs//earthporn.jpg', mode = 'wb') 
```

When downloading images, please check back with the original post to ensure you are not infringing on any copyright or privacy policy. To ensure we aren't doing that we can just delete the photograph for now.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.remove('.//outputs//earthporn.jpg')
```

It is also possible to search for a specific term within a subreddit. Here, I am going to search for images in EarthPorn with the text, "Wales".

```{r}
reddit_data <- reddit_search(search_term = "wales",
                             subreddit = "EarthPorn",
                             start_date = "2020-01-01",
                             end_date = "2022-01-01")


#inspect data
head(reddit_data)[-1] 
```

## Chalenge 2: Searching Reddit for recreational activity and an environmental feature.

Your next challenge is to search Reddit for posts containing information about a recreational activity and a an environmental feature (e.g., trees, rivers, birds). You can do this two ways, first but searching for two separate search terms at the same time using the `c()` function, e.g., `search_term = c("term1", "term2)`. We can also use the same method as above, searching for a specific term within a subreddit e.g.,  [the hiking subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/. Below I have posted some short examples:

```{r}
reddit_data <- reddit_search(search_term = c("hiking", "trees"),
                             start_date = "2022-01-01",
                             end_date = "2022-01-02")

reddit_data <- reddit_search(search_term = "mountain",
                             subreddit = "fishing",
                             start_date = "2022-01-01",
                             end_date = "2022-03-01")

reddit_data <- reddit_search(search_term = c("lake", "bird"),
                             subreddit = "hiking",
                             start_date = "2021-01-01",
                             end_date = "2022-01-01")
```

## Mapping social interactions

Here we are going to use some functions from the [RedditExtractor](https://github.com/ivan-rivera/RedditExtractor) package. `RedditExtractor` has a function called `get_reddit` which provides similar functionality to the `reddit_search()` we just used from `photosearcher`. The `get_reddit()` function returns data in a slightly different way, which may not be user friendly, however the function has the added ability to specify a minimum number of comments. Using this additional variable we can find posts that have a large number of comments and therefore discussion around landscape or ecological features. Unfortunately, an update to the package got rid of this function so we will have to download an older version to access this feature.  

```{r}
require(devtools)
install_version("RedditExtractoR", version = "2.1.5", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library("RedditExtractoR")
```

Here we use this older code to return posts discussing the grand canyon from EarthPorn with more than 500 comments.
```{r}
reddit_content <- get_reddit(
  search_terms = "Grand Canyon",
  subreddit = "EarthPorn",
  cn_threshold = 500
)
```
Once we have this data stored we can generate network maps of interactions between users.
```{r}
#large networks take long to generate so here we take the first 200 comments
reddit_content2 <- reddit_content[1:200,] 

#extract the information needed for the plot
user <- user_network(reddit_content2, 
                     include_author = FALSE, 
                     agg = TRUE)

#plot the network
user$plot
```

In the advanced method section we will go over sentiment analysis and look a bit deeper about what information we can get from textual data.
